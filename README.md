# AI-ML-Project

## Overview

1. All raw data should be kept in an immutable format in the "raw" folder. This ensures that even if something goes wrong with processing or cleaning steps, there will always be an original data to fall back on.

2. Scripts for downloading, cleaning, and processing data should be kept in the 'src/data' folder.

3. Any scripts used for model training and prediction should be kept in the 'src/models' folder.

4. Jupyter notebooks can be a helpful tool for exploratory data analysis, but should be kept separate from the main source code for cleanliness and reproducibility. These can be stored in the 'notebooks' folder.

5. Any generated figures or plots should be saved in an '`output`' or '`figures`' folder.

6. Unit tests should be included in a 'tests' directory to ensure your code is working as expected.

7. The 'requirements.txt' file should be used to specify the dependencies of your project. This is crucial for reproducing your work on other machines.

## Image Repositories

There are several well-established image repositories and databases that can be used for training computer vision models.

1. **ImageNet**: ImageNet is one of the largest and most widely used image databases in the field of machine learning. It contains over 14 million images spanning thousands of categories. The database is often used for object detection and image classification tasks. Pretrained models on ImageNet, like ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet, are widely available and often used as a starting point for transfer learning.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. COCO has several types of annotations: object detection, segmentation, keypoint detection, stuff segmentation, and image captioning. This makes it a very versatile dataset that can be used for a variety of tasks. Implementations might include Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation tasks or YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection.

3. **Open Images Dataset**: Open Images is a dataset of ~9 million images that have been annotated with image-level labels and object bounding boxes. The dataset is designed to enable visual object recognition software research. Its strength is in having multiple labels per image, object detection, segmentation, and visual relationship detection. Implementations could involve SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) or Faster R-CNN for object detection and segmentation tasks.

4. **Google's AVA (Atomic Visual Actions)**: AVA is a dataset that provides multiple "in the wild" videos, where each video contains one or more persons performing actions. Each person in a keyframe is annotated with a set of atomic visual actions from a pre-defined atomic visual action vocabulary. The AVA dataset densely annotates 80 atomic visual actions in 430 15-minute video clips, where actions are localized in space and time, resulting in 1.58M action labels with multiple labels per person occurring frequently. For implementations, I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNet) models can be used for action recognition in videos.

5. **MNIST and Fashion-MNIST**: MNIST is a classic database of handwritten digits, and is often used as the "Hello, World!" of machine learning. Fashion-MNIST is a slightly more challenging drop-in replacement for the original MNIST. Both can be used for image classification tasks, with implementations like simple fully-connected networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or more advanced architectures.

6. **CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset)**: CelebA is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. It can be used for face recognition tasks or attribute prediction tasks. Implementations could include variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs), such as the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), for tasks related to face generation.

## Following steps

1. **Data Collection and Annotation**: The first step is to collect a large amount of road imagery data. This could involve taking photos or videos of various roads in different conditions and lighting. This data should include a wide range of pothole types, sizes, and degrees of wear. We would then need to manually annotate these images, marking the potholes' locations and sizes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Once the data is collected and annotated, it needs to be preprocessed for the model. This step typically includes resizing the images to a standard format, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.

3. **Model Selection**: For object detection tasks, models like Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) are widely used. It would be essential to evaluate these models' performance based on the available dataset and computational resources.

4. **Model Training**: Train the selected model using TensorFlow on the preprocessed data. Make sure to use techniques like early stopping, learning rate schedules, and data augmentation to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: After the model is trained, evaluate its performance on the test dataset. Use metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and Intersection over Union (IoU) to quantify the model's accuracy.

6. **Deployment**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a real-world environment. The model should be able to process real-time data and detect potholes in various conditions.

7. **Post-deployment Monitoring**: Even after the model is deployed, continue monitoring its performance. Keep an eye on any potential drift in data or model performance and be ready to retrain the model if necessary.

8. **Iterative Improvement**: Gather feedback from the deployed model's performance, make necessary adjustments and updates, and continuously improve the model over time.

This TensorFlow-based solution could help urban municipalities significantly improve their road maintenance and repair procedures, ultimately leading to safer and smoother road conditions for everyone.
